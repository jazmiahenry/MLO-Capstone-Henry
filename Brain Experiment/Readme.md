## Background
While training Brain using both Q and Policy Hidden Layers, Bonsai UI began to stall with background AI Engine unable to identify new iteration champions leading to suboptimal
Brain performance and training progress. 

Bonsai UI Chart looks like this:

As a result, I conducted an experiment to get to the root of the issue. With the help of Help-Client team, the root cause and solution was found.

## Solution

Such Brain architecture appears to be exhausting the capacity of the pod. Due to this, move Brain to multi-node cluster by adding the following to the top of 
Brain's inkling file:

```
experiment {
horizontal_scaling: "True",
num_cores_per_ray_node: "2000m",
memory_per_ray_node: "33Gi",
num_workers: "6",
num_rollout_worker_nodes: "6",
rollout_worker_cpu: "2000m",
rollout_worker_memory: "33Gi",
}
```

* Before scaling cluster node, turn off AI Manager use in Alpha features within Bonsai as they are not yet integrated with scaling capabilities.
