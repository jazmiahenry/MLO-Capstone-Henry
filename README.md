| Objective              | maximize product production     |   Example: For a can manufacturing line, the goal is to maximize can production                        |
| Constraints            |   NA |
| Observations           | Conveyors speed, machines speed, machines_state infeed and discharge proxes, sink_machines_rate, sink_throughput_delta_sum, illegal_machine_actions, illegal_conveyor_actions, remaining_downtime_machines, control_delta_t | Proxes are sensors that yield a binary value. When product accumulates on the conveyor and covers the location of the prox sensor, its value becomes 1, otherwise it's value is zero, illegal actions happen with machines are in down or idle mode but brain sends a nonzero action, which will be ignored by the simulator but will return a flag to inform brain, remaining_downtime informs brain about remaining downtime for each machine. Active or idle machines yield zero for the their remaining downtime. sink_throughput_delta_sum is the amount of productions(throughput) between control actions, machine state -1 means down, 0 means idle, 1 means active|
| Actions                |  Machines | Speeds are processed in cans/second units|
| Control Frequency      | Fixed, event driven, or mix of both fixed and event driven control  | User can specify control frequency from inkling using |
| Episode configurations | control_type (fixed, event driven, or mix of both), control_frequency (for fixed and mix), inter_downtime_event_mean (average time between downtime events),inter_downtime_event_dev, downtime_event_duration_mean, downtime_event_duration_dev, number_parallel_downtime_events, layout_configuration |Note: currently only one default layout is supported. |

## Solution approach
4 solutions approaches are being tested. 
approach 1: fixed time control frequency with illegal actions. 
approach 2: event driven with no illegal actions.
approach 3: multi concept, equipment down concepts 
approach 4: Action space reduction 

## Background about manufacturing line

The line consists of a fixed number of machines that are connected through conveyors. The products (i.e., cans) enter the line through the source that is located at the left most side of the line, move from one machine to another machine until they reach the sink at the rightmost end of the line where all the products would be accumulated. There are sensors (proxes) located at certain points along the conveyor that assess the status of products (i.e., cans) accumulation on the conveyor. The prox that is located at the right end of conveyor (prior to next machine) is called the Infeed prox and the prox that is located at the left end of conveyor (after the previous machine) is called the Discharge prox. The Infeed prox decides whether there are enough products (i.e., cans) on the conveyor that can be fed into the next machine to determine whether it is worth keeping the machine ON. If there are not enough products (i.e., cans) available that can be fed into the next machine, then the Infeed prox would decide to shut down the machine simply because the conveyor is under-loaded.
In contrary, the Discharge prox decides whether there are too many products (i.e., cans) on the conveyor such that the previous machine would not find enough space on the conveyor to process new products (i.e., cans). Therefore, the Discharge prox would decide to shut down the machine simply because the conveyor is over-loaded.

To model the conveyor, it is assumed that each conveyor consists of N bins - indexed from 0 to N-1 - and the accumulation of products (i.e., cans) on the conveyor happens from the right end of conveyor (bin index N-1) until it reaches to the left end of conveyor (bin index 0). In the following, the process of how products (i.e., cans) are moved along the conveyor from one machine to another machine is explained.

For sake of explanation, it is assumed that the product of interest is "can" and that the conveyor has a capacity of 1000 and it consists of 10 bins (N = 10) and, therefore, each bin has a maximum capacity of 100. Let's also assume that the each bin initially contains 50 cans. Note that conveyor operates at a much higher speed than the machines, thus the conveyor speed is not a limiting factor in the movement of cans from one machine to another machine. 

|             | Speed | 
| ----------- | ----- | 
| conveyor    | 2000  |
| machine 1   |  100  |
| machine 2   |  40   |

At time 0, the last bin (bin # 9) of machine 1 passes 40 cans out of its current 50 cans to machine 2 because machine 2 can only process 40 cans per minute - it has a speed of 40 cans per minute. Simultaneously, machine 1 processes 100 cans and aims to place them in the last bin (bin # 9) of the conveyor since product accumulation happens from the last bin of the conveyor. However, since bin # 9 already containts 10  cans, it can only take 90 more cans to reach its maximum capacity of 100 cans. Therefore, the remaining 10 cans that have been processed by machine 1 would be placed in bin # 8.

At time 1, the last bin (bin # 9) of machine 1 passes its 10 cans to machine 2. Simultaneously, machine 1 processes another set of 100 cans and places all the 100 cans in its last bin (bin # 9) since it is empty. Therefore, the last bin (bin # 9) contains 100 cans.

At time 2, the last bin (bin # 9) only passes 40 (out of its 100) cans to machine 2 since machine 2 can only process 40 cans at once. Machine 1 processes 100 cans and would like to place them in last bin (bin # 9). However, since last bin (bin # 9) is partially full, machine 1 can only place 40 cans in last bin (bin # 9) and the ramaining 60 cans are placed in bin # 8 which was already carrying 10 cans. Total level of bin # 8 is now increased to 70 cans.

This process will keep running and if can accumulation reaches the first bin (bin # 0), then the Discharge prox after machine 1 will decide to shut down machine 1 since it assumes that the conveyor is over-loaded.

### Dockerize Simulator for Scaling and add the sim package

```
docker build -t <IMAGE_NAME> -f Dockerfile .
az acr login --subscription <SUBSCRIPTION_ID> --name <ACR_REGISTRY_NAME
docker tag <IMAGE_NAME> <ACR_REGISTRY_NAME>.azurecr.io/bonsai/<IMAGE_NAME>
docker push <ACR_REGSITRY_NAME>.azurecr.io/bonsai/<IMAGE_NAME>
```
Add the simulator in the Web UI. To scale with multiple simulators, one can select the simulation to scale in two ways:

1) write `package "<SimName>"` in the simulator clause in inkling
2) click the Train button and select the simulator

TODO: Run the simulation with rendering using the following flag. If you add the `--test` flag, you will run using an exported brain with `http://localhost:5000`.

```sh
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 <acr_name>.azurecr.io/<workspace_id>/<brain_name>:<version>
python bonsai_integration.py --render --test
